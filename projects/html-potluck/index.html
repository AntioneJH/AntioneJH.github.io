    <p>
    While exploring her new home, a girl named Coraline (Dakota Fanning) 
    discovers a secret door, behind which lies an alternate world that closely 
    mirrors her own but, in many ways, is better. She rejoices in her discovery,
    until Other Mother (Teri Hatcher) and the rest of her parallel family try 
    to keep her there forever. Coraline must use all her resources and bravery 
    to make it back to her own family and life.
