            Bleach (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese anime television series 
            based on Tite Kubo's original manga series of the same name. It was 
            produced by Pierrot and directed by Noriyuki Abe. The series aired
            on TV Tokyo from October 2004 to March 2012, spanning 366 episodes.
            The story follows the adventures of Ichigo Kurosaki after he 
            obtains the powers of a Soul Reaper—a death personification similar
            to the Grim Reaper—from another Soul Reaper, Rukia Kuchiki. 
            His newfound powers force him to take on the duties of defending 
            humans from evil spirits and guiding departed souls to the 
            afterlife. In addition to adapting the manga series it is based on,
            the anime periodically includes original self-contained storylines
            and characters not found in the source material.

            Viz Media obtained foreign television and home video distribution 
            rights to the Bleach anime in March 2006. Bleach was broadcast in 
            the United States on Adult Swim from September 2006 to November
            2014.

                The series adapts Kubo's manga with the main story arcs and
                introduces anime exclusive ones. In Karakura Town, high school 
                student Ichigo Kurosaki becomes a substitute Soul Reaper 
                (死神, Shinigami, literally, "Death God"), when Rukia Kuchiki
                risks her life to protect him from a Hollow. Although 
                initially reluctant to accept his responsibility, 
                he takes her place, and during this time they discover
                that a few classmates are spiritually aware and have their
                own powers: Quincy survivor Uryū Ishida uses spiritual
                particles, Orihime Inoue has a group of protective 
                spirits called Shun Shun Rikka and Yasutora Sado 
                ("Chad") has strength equal to the Hollows encased 
                in his arm.
